            <!-- Write a brief biography about yourself here. -->
            Giacomo A. Baldelli (2002) is a filmmaker, cinematographer and actor. After studying audiovisual arts in high school, he quickly decided to deepen his knowledge on film in college. He then got his bachelor's degree in Film at Luca School of Arts in Brussels, where he focused on making short films and started experimenting with different formats, ranging from fiction to documentary and hybrid films. In these years he explored his visual style and way of storytelling. The topics of his films range from his fascination for the digital world, to the human body, to the search of his own roots, as he is a second-generation child of an Italian guest worker family in Belgium, who worked in the coal mines of Limburg.
            Next to his own works he worked as a cinematographer on films of his fellow students such as Florian Saerens, where he got the chance to explore the visual side of storytelling. Giacomo also acted in films from his fellow student, Caene Diaz Toledo, as he wanted to explore the world in front of the camera. Later on he then started acting in some of his own short films.
            Besides his school projects he also made some music videos for established and aspiring musicians. In 2022 he worked with musician and performance artist Mauro Pawlowski and actor Louis van der Waal to direct a music video for Mauro’s song ‘In de straten van Berchem’. In 2023 he worked with Madd9, musician and performer, and went on to direct a music video for Madd9’s first single ‘Selfish’ released under the management of Beatville. Later on Giacomo also directed 'Gone' for Madd9 (2024).
